LYRICS

Baby
You’ve been so distant from me lately
And lately
Don’t even wanna call you baby

Saw us getting older
Burning toast in the toaster
My ambitions were too high

Waiting up for you upstairs
Why you act like I’m not there? 
Baby right now it feels like-
It feels like 

You don’t care
Why don’t you recognize I’m so rare? 
Always there
You don’t do the same for me,
That’s not fair
I don’t have it all
I’m not claiming to 
But I know that I'm special, yeah
And I’ll bet there’s somebody else out there
To tell me I’m rare
To make me feel rare

Baby
Don’t make me count up all the reasons to stay with you
No reason 
Why you and I are not succeeding
Uh uh

Saw us getting older
Burning toast in the toaster
My ambitions were too high

Waiting up for you upstairs
Why you act like I’m not there? 
Baby right now it feels like- 
It feels like 

You don’t care
Why don’t you recognize I’m so rare? 
Always there
You don’t do the same for me that’s not fair
I don’t have it all
I’m not claiming to 
But I know that I'm special, yeah
And I’ll bet there’s somebody else out there
To tell me I’m rare
To make me feel rare

I’m not gonna beg for you
I’m not gonna let you make me cry
Make me cry

Not getting enough from you
Didn’t you know I’m hard to find?
(Hard to find)

Saw us getting older
Burning toast in the toaster
My ambitions were too high-

Waiting up for you upstairs
Why you act like I’m not there? 
Baby right now it feels like, 
It feels like 

You don’t care
Why don’t you recognize I’m so rare?
Always there
You don’t do the same for me
That’s not fair
I don’t have it all
I’m not claiming to 
But I know that I'm special, yeah
And I’ll bet there’s somebody else out there
To tell me I’m rare
To make me feel rare

LYRICS

Happiness ain’t something you sit back and you wait for
(Mmm, uhuh) 
Confidence is throwing your heart through every brick wall 
(Mmm, uhuh)

I kick-start the rhythm 
All the trauma’s in remission
No I don’t need permission 

Feels so feels so feels so good to dance again 
Feels so feels so feels so good to dance again
With my emotions undressed 
I’m going in with everything to 
Dance again
Feels so feels so feels so good 

Vulnerable ain’t easy, believe me, 
but I go there 
(Mmm uhuh)
It’s like I’m ten feet tall-
I’m high off the weight off my shoulders 
(Mmm uhuh)

I kick-start the rhythm 
All the trauma’s in remission
No I don’t need permission 

I kick-start my system 
When I speak my body listens 
I know what I’m missing 

Feels so feels so feels so good to dance again 
Feels so feels so feels so good to dance again
With my emotions undressed 
I’m going in with everything to 
Dance again
Feels so feels so feels so good 

Ooooh, ooooh
I’m feeling-
Ooooh, ooooh
Me again
Ooooh, ooooh
Feels so good to dance again
Feels so feels so feels so good

Happiness ain’t something you sit back and you wait for-
Feels so feels so feels so good to dance again

Feels so feels so feels so good to dance again 
With my emotions undressed 
I’m going in with everything to 
Dance again
Feels so feels so feels so good 

I kick-start the rhythm 
All the trauma’s in remission

I kick-start the rhythm 
All the trauma’s in remission

Feels so feels so feels so good

LYRICS

They fell in love one summer
A little too wild for each other
shiny till it wasn’t
Feels good till it doesn’t

It was her first real lover
His too till he had another
Oh god when she found out
Trust levels went way down

Of course she was sad
But now she’s glad she dodged a bullet

Took a few years
to soak up the tears
But look at her now
Watch her go

Mmm mmm mmm
Look at her now
Watch her go
Mmm mmm mmm
Wow
Look at her now
Mmm mmm mmm
Look at her now
Watch her go
Mmm mmm mmm
Wow
Look at her now

Fast nights that got him
That new life was his problem
Not saying she was perfect
Still regrets that moment

Like that night
Wasn’t wrong, wasn’t right
What a thing to be human
Made her more of woman

Of course she was sad
But now she’s glad she dodged a bullet

Took a few years
to soak up the tears
But look at her now
Watch her go

Mmm mmm mmm
Look at her now
Watch her go
Mmm mmm mmm
Wow
Look at her now
Mmm mmm mmm
Look at her now
Watch her go
Mmm mmm mmm
Wow
Look at her now

She knows she’ll find love
only if she wants it
She knows she’ll find love
Uhh
She knows she’ll find love
Only if she wants it
She knows she’ll find love
On the up from the way down
Look at her now

Watch her go
Mmm mmm
Look at her now
Ohhhhh
She knows she’ll find love
Only if she wants it
She knows she’ll find love
Look at her now yeah
She knows she’ll find love
(She knows she will)
Only if she wants it
She knows she’ll find love
Wow

Look at her now.

LYRICS

You promised the world and I fell for it 
I put you first and you adored it
You set fires to my forest
And you let it burn 
Sang off key in my chorus 
Cause it wasn’t yours 
I saw the signs and I ignored it 
Rose colored glasses all distorted 
You set fire to my purpose
And I let it burn 
You got off on the hurtin’ 
When it wasn’t yours 
We’d always go into it blindly
I needed to lose you to find me 
This dancing was killing me softly
I needed to hate you to love me 

To love love yeah
To love love yeah
To love yeah
I needed to lose you to love me 
To love love yeah
To love love yeah
To love yeah
I needed to lose you to love me
I gave my all and they all know it
You tore me down and now it’s showing 
In two months you replaced us
Like it was easy
Made me think I deserved it
In the thick of healing 
We’d always go into it blindly
I needed to lose you to find me 
This dancing was killing me softly 
I needed to hate you to love me 

To love love yeah
To love love yeah
To love yeah
I needed to lose you to love me 
To love love yeah
To love love yeah
To love yeah
I needed to lose you to love me 
You promised the world and I fell for it 
I put you first and you adored it
You set fires to my forest
And you let it burn 
Sang off key in my chorus- 

To love love yeah
To love love yeah
To love yeah
I needed to hate you to love me
To love love yeah
To love love yeah
To love yeah
I needed to lose you to love me
To love love yeah
To love love yeah
To love yeah

And now the chapter is closed and done 
And now it’s goodbye
It’s goodbye for us

LYRICS

You all in your feelings baby 
All into me
I’m one in a billion baby 
Don’t you agree 
Obviously you know I’m aware of that 
I’m breakin’ hearts like a heart attack 
Got ‘em right where the carats at 

Wrapped round my finger like a ring, ring, ring 
They just like puppets on a string, string, string 
I put it down they call me up
They doing way too much 
So I just let it ring, ring, ring 

Yeah, I received your message 
All 23
You know I’m Jordan with it
G.O.A.T. 
Obviously you know I’m aware of that 
I’m breakin’ hearts like a heart attack 
I got ‘em right where the carats at 

Wrapped round my finger like a ring, ring, ring 
They just like puppets on a string, string, string 
I put it down they call me up
They doing way too much 
So I just let it ring, ring, ring

Wrapped round my finger like a ring, ring, ring 
They wanna give me everything, thing, thing
I put it down they call me up
Oh no no no no no
So I just let it ring, ring, ring

Circling me they just like satellites 
Circling me all day and every night 
Circling me I’m sure you sympathize 
Oh la la la la la la la 
Oh na na

Wrapped round my finger like a ring, ring, ring 
They just like puppets on a string, string, string 
I put it down they call me up
They doing way too much 
So I just let it ring, ring, ring

Wrapped round my finger like a ring, ring, ring 
They wanna give me everything, thing, thing
I put it down they call me up
Oh no no no no no
So I just let it ring, ring, ring

LYRICS

If I give you every piece of me, I know that you could drop it 
Give you the chance, I know that you could take advantage once you got it 
If I open up my heart to you I know that you could lock it 
Throw away the key and keep it there forever in your pocket 

If I give the opportunity to you then would you blow it?
If I was the greatest thing to happen to ya, would you know it?
If my love was like a flower would you plant it, would you grow it? 
Imma give you all my body, are you strong enough to hold it? 

If I show you all my demons 
And we dive into the deep end 
Would we crash and burn like every time before?
I would tell you all my secrets 
Wrap your arms around my weakness
If the only other option’s letting go-
I’ll stay vulnerable 
I’ll stay vulnerable 
I’ll stay vulnerable 

If I hand you my emotions, would you even wanna take it? 
If I give you all my trust then would you fumble it and break it?
If I let you cross my finish line then would you wanna make it?
I think I’m ready, won’t you come and flip the switch and activate it? 

If I show you all my demons 
And we dive into the deep end 
Would we crash and burn like every time before?
I would tell you all my secrets 
Wrap your arms around my weakness
If the only other option’s letting go-
I’ll stay vulnerable 
I’ll stay vulnerable 
I’ll stay vulnerable 

If I show you all my demons 
And we dive into the deep end 
Would we crash and burn like every time before?
I would tell you all my secrets 
Wrap your arms around my weakness
If the only other option’s letting go-
I’ll stay vulnerable 
(Yeah)
I’ll stay vulnerable 
(Yeah)

If I show you all my demons 
And we dive into the deep end 
Would we crash and burn like every time before?
(I’ll stay vulnerable)
I would tell you all my secrets 
Wrap your arms around my weakness
If the only other option’s letting go-
I’ll stay vulnerable

LYRICS

You were running through me like water
Now the feeling’s leaving me dry 
These days we couldn’t be farther 
So how’s it feel to be on the other side?

So many wasted nights with you 
I still can taste it, I hate it 
Wish I could take it back 'cause-

We used to be close
But people can go from people you know
To people you don’t 
And what hurts the most 
Is people can go from people you know
To people you don’t 

We used to be close
But people can go from people you know
To people you don’t 
And what hurts the most 
Is people can go from people you know
To people you don’t 

When it was good we were on fire
Now I’m breathing ashes and dust
I always wanna get higher-
I never know when enough is enough 

So many wasted nights with you 
I still can taste it, I hate it 
Wish I could take it back, 'cause-

We used to be close
But people can go from people you know
To people you don’t 
And what hurts the most 
Is people can go from people you know
To people you don’t 

We used to be close
But people can go from people you know
To people you don’t 
And what hurts the most 
Is people can go from people you know
To people you don’t 

From people you know to people you don’t
From people you know to people you don’t

We used to be close
But people can go from people you know
To people you don’t 
And what hurts the most 
Is people can go from people you know
To people you don’t 

We used to be close
But people can go from people you know
To people you don’t 
And what hurts the most 
Is people can go from people you know
To people you don’t 

From people you know to people you don’t
From people you know to people you don’t
From people you know to people you don’t
From people you know to people you don’t

LYRICS

Like a prayer surrounding us, moving effortlessly 
Every word is relief 
I’m in dance floor therapy, all my babies and me 
But tonight it’s for free 
 
No self-sabotage, no letting my thoughts run 
Me and this spiral are done
Burn this camouflage I’ve been wearing for months 
Tryna let a little happy in for once- 

I need to let my mind rest 
While my body reflects 
 
Ooh
Don’t get me down 
I won’t let me get me 
Ooh
Don’t get me down 
I won’t let me get me 
Ooh
I’m good right now 
I won’t let me get me 
Ooh
Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside 
Out
 
Diving in ferociously, dancing intimately 
I’m so connected to me 
In the dark I’m letting go, so anonymously 
I guess this is what it feels like to be free 
 
I need to let my mind rest (my my my)
While my body reflects

Ooh
Don’t get me down 
I won’t let me get me 
Ooh
Don’t get me down 
I won’t let me get me 
Ooh
I’m good right now 
I won’t let me get me 
Ooh
Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside 
Out

Ooh
Don’t get me down 
I won’t let me get me 
Ooh
Don’t get me down 
I won’t let me get me 
Ooh
I’m good right now 
I won’t let me get me 
Ooh
Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside 
Out

Oh my-
I guess this is what it feels like to be free (oooh)
Oh my- 
I guess this is what it feels like to see me (oooh)
Down-

Ooh
Get down (don’t get me)
Ooh
Get down (don’t get me)
Ooh
Get down
Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside 

Ooh
Don’t get me down 
I won’t let me get me 
Ooh
Don’t get me down 
I won’t let me get me 
Ooh
I’m good right now 
I won’t let me get me 
Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside 
Out

LYRICS

Baby it’s just me and you
Baby it’s just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room,
Baby it’s just me and you
Yeah

It started polite, out on thin ice, 
'Til you came over to break it
I threw you a line and you were mine

Yeah I was afraid, but you made it safe,
I guess that is our combination
Said you feel lost, well so do I

So won’t you call me in the morning? 
I think that you should call me in the morning
If you feel the same, 'cause-

Baby it’s just me and you
Baby it’s just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room,
Baby it’s just me and you
Yeah

Baby it’s just me and you
Baby it’s just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room,
Baby it’s just me and you
Yeah

Engulfed in the flames, engulfed in the shame,
Betrayed by your imagination 
In over my head, but that’s alright

So won’t you call me in the morning? 
I think that you should call me in the morning
If you feel the same, 'cause-
Baby it’s just me and you
Baby it’s just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room,
Baby it’s just me and you
Yeah

Baby it’s just me and you
Baby it’s just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room,
Baby it’s just me and you

The world keeps on spinning but I ain't dizzy yet
The more that you give, give, give, give
The more that you get

It’s just, us two in the crowd we feel alone
I turn every chair that you sit in into a throne
Not too many of ‘em put it down like me
I say it humbly but they don’t wear the crown like me 

It’s all in your eyes, locked, loaded, we were rollin’ 
You make the whole room feel slow motion
You make me feel like I’m drowning in a potion
Closed off, tryna get a lil open

The more that I give, the more that I get
So baby imma call you in the A.M.
You down for my love honey say when 
I’ll be waitin' on my time ‘cause I’m patient 

Baby it’s just me and you
Baby it’s just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room,
Baby it’s just me and you
Yeah

Baby it’s just me and you
Baby it’s just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room,
Baby it’s just me and you
Yeah

LYRICS

Hey, you started out sweeter than hard candy 
Words were like licorice to the taste 
But slowly all the sugar it went to waste 
Went to waste-

Oh, you started getting funny with no jokes 
I started seeing through you like a ghost 
And now I'm pretty sure I can't take no more 
I can't take no more-

I think you’re kinda crazy 
And not the good kind baby 
'Cause you're acting super shady 
You know it 
You know it 
Been dodging phone calls lately 
But still texting me baby 
Yeah I think you're kinda crazy 
You know it 
You know it 
You been lying just for fun 
Luckily no damage done 
But now I see you’re kinda crazy 
You know it 
You know it 
Uh oh

Hey, you're the one who started talking to me 
Made the move, asked me to be your babe 
And now you're treating me like I'm insane-
You're insane 

I think you’re kinda crazy 
And not the good kind baby 
'Cause you're acting super shady 
You know it 
You know it 
Been dodging phone calls lately 
But still texting me baby 
Yeah I think you're kinda crazy 
You know it 
You know it 
You been lying just for fun 
Luckily no damage done 
But now I see you’re kinda crazy 
You know it 
You know it 
Uh oh

I think you’re kinda crazy 
And not the good kind baby 
'Cause you're acting super shady 
You know it 
You know it 
Been dodging phone calls lately 
But still texting me baby 
Yeah I think you're kinda crazy 
You know it 
You know it
Uh oh

LYRICS

This is just what the doctor ordered
Put a gold star on my disorder
Yeah we’ve talked around every corner
If I’m looking at you and me
We’re on some kind of symmetry

I’m a sensitive situation
You’re a hot and cold combination 
Oh, we both know we got complications
If I’m looking at you and me
We’re on some kind of symmetry 

I try not to bother 
Not to bother you
But my kind of trouble
Likes your trouble too

Can’t stop myself
It’s true
I like the way you move
Uh huh
We got something in this room
Can’t make that up
You may not be the one
Uh huh
But you look like fun 
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah

You look like fun (oh fun)
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah

Can we keep it on a first name basis?
We could overcrowd each other’s spaces 
You get me higher than my medication
Take me to different places
Let’s face it
I’m getting impatient 

I try not to bother 
Not to bother you
But my kind of trouble
Likes your trouble too

Can’t stop myself
It’s true
I like the way you move
Uh huh
We got something in this room
Can’t make that up
You may not be the one
Uh huh
But you look like fun
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah

You look like fun
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
You look like-

You don’t, but you know how
Like a beautiful breakdown
And it’s just not right
But you look like-

You don’t, but you know how
Make me wanna slow down
And it’s just not right
But you look like-

Fun
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah

You look like fun
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah

You look like 
Fun

LYRICS

Pull up to the mirror staring at my face
Gotta chop chop all the extra weight
I’ve been carrying for 1460 days
Gotta, gotta, gotta clean my slate

And I might as well just tell you while I’m drunk, yeah
The truth is that I think I’ve had enough
Professionally messing with my trust
How could I confuse that sh*t for love?

So I gotta get you out my head now
I just cut you off
You out my head now
I just cut you off
When I’m without you
I don’t overthink it, I just carry on
Get you out my head now
I just cut you off

I imagine all the endless places I could know
If I - drop drop and I let you go
All the possibilities I got from head to toe
Yeah they’d, yeah they’d, yeah they’d start to show

And I might as well just tell you while I’m drunk, yeah
The truth is that I think I’ve had enough
Emotionally messing with my health
How could I confuse that sh*t for love?

So I gotta get you out my head now
I just cut you off
You out my head now
I just cut you off
When I’m without you
I don’t overthink I just carry on
Get you out my head now
I just-
I just

You out my head now-
(I just)
When I’m without-
You out my head now
So I gotta get-

You out my head now
I just cut you off
(Yeah I cut you off)
You out my head now
I just cut you off
When I’m without you
I don’t overthink it, I just carry on
Get you out my head now
I just- 
I just
Yeah

LYRICS

Is there a place where I can hide away?
Red lips, french kiss my worries all away
There must be a sweeter place
We can sugarcoat the taste
A sweeter place 
There must be a sweeter-
(Place where I can)

Oh,
You really wanna know where I’ve been all this time?
So let me tell ya
Oh,
Got two feet on the ground and felt what real is like
What it was like
Living 
Out of the scene 
Out in the wild 
Learning to breathe 
Up in the clouds
Far from the crowds 
I can’t believe 
I can be loud 
Holding hands with the darkness 
And knowing my heart is allowed
Allowed

Is there a place where I can hide away?
Red lips, french kiss my worries all away
There must be a sweeter place
We can sugarcoat the taste
A sweeter place 
There must be a sweeter-
(Place where I can)

As I fantasize
So much to see
I’m in paradise
Ohh I- 

Oh, it seems I’m new inside 
Deep deep down in me, I go now baby
Born to fly
Ohh I- 

Now see how could it be
We will find our way 
We'll find the things we seek

Ooowee

You see I’m mesmerized
A place that’s just for me
And I am cuttin’ ties
Goodbye

Is there a place where I can hide away?
Red lips, french kiss my worries all away
There must be a sweeter place
We can sugarcoat the taste
A sweeter place 
There must be a sweeter-
(Place where I can)

Having no fear, heaven is near
Ooh
Head is so clear
A sweeter place
My sweeter place-

Having no fear, heaven is near
Ooh
Head is so clear
My sweeter place
My sweeter place-

Is there a place where I can hide away?
Red lips, french kiss my worries all away
There must be a sweeter place
We can sugarcoat the taste
A sweeter place 
There must be a sweeter- 
(Place where I can)
